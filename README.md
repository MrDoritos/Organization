# Organization
Hybrid tag and hierarchical organization manager

## Goal

Make my life easier by managing what used to be in a spreadsheet.

## Compiling

You need [my 2nd Http Server](https://github.com/MrDoritos/HTTP-Server-v2)

You also need a few more things to compile, I don't expect anyone to be interested, but if you are, ping me at [my email](mailto:ianmoore322@gmail.com?Subject=Commit%20your%20repositories) or [my reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/MrDoritos_)
